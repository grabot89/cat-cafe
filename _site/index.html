    Our Cat Café opened it's doors in November 2022.<br>
    In the  cat café  guests can come, enjoy the company of our cats over a warm or cool drink and experience the benefits of some purrrrrrrrrr therapy.<br> 
    We believe that the cat café is a great place for cat lovers to visit especially those who are unable to have pets at their homes due to the pace of their lives, allergies, financial situation, responsibility of owning a cat, not allowed pets on their rental, and many other reasons. <br>
    Research has shown that hearing a cat purr can lower your blood pressure and stroking a cat can slow your heart rate. So by stopping, resting, and watching, it is Cat Café’s aim to enable people to become more mindful and present in their day-to-day lives.<br>
<aside>
    At The Paw Lounge Cafe not only will you be able to get acquainted with our gorgeous cats, but you will also receive award winning teas, coffees & hot chocolates.<br>
    <br>
     We also light bites, pastries & indulgent cake. Vegan and Gluten free options are also available. Please look at our menu <a href="/cafe">for full selection.
